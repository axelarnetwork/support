# Developer Support
Welcome to our developer support repository!

To get help, [search the closed existing issues](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/support/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed), and if you don't find what you are looking for, [open a new issue](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/support/issues/new)!

This GitHub issue repository is designed to replace our Discord support in a way that makes it possible for past questions to show up in search results.
